# Sentiment-Analysis-Rotten-Tomatoes
 

* This project explores various text classification methods, with a particular focus on the task of sentiment analysis, with the aim of determining the emotional polarity expressed in movie reviews published on the Rotten Tomatoes website. 

* The work includes the definition of a baseline using existing tools, the application of a sentiment lexicon with and without negation treatment, and pre-processing steps. These are applied to classification models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. 

* Finally, a pre-trained model based on transformers and a generative model for sentiment classification are also applied. The Multinomial Naive Bayes model excelled in this study, showing superiority in all the evaluation metrics used.
